  description: "\nThis API returns data from the US Census Bureau American Community\
    \ Survey (ACS) for a given spatial location of interest.\n\nThe API returns estimated\
    \ values for socio-economic variables and related variables for small geographic\
    \ areas that may act as indirect indicators of relevant health behaviors and outcomes.\
    \ The data are collected by the US Census Bureau and are publicly available.\n\
    \nThe variables are taken from the five-year summary data file of the US Census\
    \ Bureau ACS, which is constructed from five annual waves of the bureau’s largest\
    \ household survey. Approximately, two million households have completed the survey\
    \ annually since calendar year 2005. (Five waves of the survey before 2005 sampled\
    \ approximately 500,000 households each.) See\_https://www.census.gov/acs/www/methodology/sample-size-and-data-quality/sample-size/\_\
    for more detail. Microdata are available, but small-area data are only available\
    \ in summary tabulations.\n\nValues are provided at the US Census Block Group\
    \ level, representing the 2012-2016 calendar-year period for locations within\
    \ the continental USA. Block groups, the smallest geographic area for which sample\
    \ survey data are released, generally contain 600 to 3,000 people (e.g., the size\
    \ of a single city apartment building). Block Groups are aggregates of an average\
    \ of 39 Blocks each, each of which is delineated by visible and invisible geographic\
    \ boundaries. Block groups, in turn, are aggregated into Census Tracts, which\
    \ generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum\
    \ size of 4,000 people. Census Tracts aggregate into counties and counties into\
    \ states. Metropolitan and micropolitan areas are aggregates of counties. See\_\
    https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/geodiagram.pdf\_for further detail.\
    \ Census geography, even Block Groups, may cross municipal lines and may include\
    \ both urbanized and rural areas. Because population is a large factor in determining\
    \ Census geography, some Block Groups may cover an extensive rural or wilderness\
    \ area while others are quite compact. Census Block, Block Group, and Tract boundaries\
    \ may change somewhat with each decennial Census, but remain stable in between\
    \ Censuses.\n\nThe US Census Bureau is mandated to preserve the confidentiality\
    \ of individual-level data. Therefore, data are often summarized, coarsened into\
    \ categories, or suppressed by complex secret algorithms (especially, but not\
    \ limited to household income data). In addition, because the variables of interest\
    \ may only apply to a small subset of Block Group missing data can occur. In some\
    \ versions of the data, calculated values are suppressed in Block Groups with\
    \ less than 50 residents.\n\nStandard errors for the socio-demographic variables\
    \ are provided. Because each of the values in the ACS data files are summary statistics\
    \ calculated from sample survey data for each Block Group, different samples yield\
    \ somewhat different values. Therefore, the Census Bureau generates 80 replicate\
    \ values for selected variables. These provide the basis for the estimated standard\
    \ errors of the estimates.\n\nThe currently available variables are listed here:\n\
