## Census Data details for Socio-Economic API

The data originated with three source files:
  1.	trans_geo_cross,
  2.	Appold_renci_US_22August, and
  3.	Appold_renci_US_replse_20October18.
      
The first file contains a set of geographic identifiers, while the second two files contain the socio-demographic variables. The third file differs from the second file in that it includes standard errors for each of the socio-demographic estimates. The variable values on that file were calculated from the 2012â€“-2016 (five-year summary file) of the American Community Survey. Because each of the values in the ACS data files represent summary statistics calculated from sample survey data for each Block Group, different samples yield somewhat different values. Therefore, the US Census Bureau generates 80 replicate values for selected variables. These provide the basis for the estimated standard errors of the estimates.

The second and third files contain slightly different values in some cases, but there is no reason to link them with each other. Because there are no standard errors, the second file is easier to use and adequate for most purposes. However, it may be useful for some researchers to link one of the data files with the file containing the geographic identifiers. GEOID provides a common identifier. Removing the first seven characters from GEOID allows for an easy linkage to ESRI (ArcInfo), Quantum, and other GIS software.

Locations are expressed using WGS84 decimal format. WGS84 is the World Geodetic System for expressing latitude and longitude. For example, the Statue of Liberty in New York City is at latitude 40.689249 and longitude -74.044500.

Additional details on the variables are provided in the tables below.
